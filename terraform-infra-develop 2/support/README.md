# Support folder 
**SUPPORT** folder created for work tasks.
> **Note:** the name of the subfolders is the same as the name of the tickets in Jira.  

Please create a new folder for all new tasks 

#### IMPORTANT! 
- Firstly please change terraform.tfvars

Terraform file on the root folder of project. 

**environment**  - a variable that contains the name of the task

**account_id** - number of AWS account (will be used in future) 





- Secondary - need to change backend.tf

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "backet_for_tfstate_files"
    region = "some_region"
    key    = "<Project>-<same_task>/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```
- **key    ="..."**     - unique path to tfstate file
- **region = "..."**       - region of backet for tfstate files
